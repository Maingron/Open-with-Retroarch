# Nintendo Switch

## Overview
blah blah, Nintendo Switch, we all know and love it, developed by Nintendo, blah blah.

## Emulators
1. **Yuzu**
	- Was **taken down** by Nintendo.
	- Requires title.keys (and firmware)

2. **Ryujinx**
	- Was **taken down** by Nintendo.
	- Bring your own title.keys (and firmware)

3. **Citron**
	- AI says it's not based on / forked from Yuzu, but I think it is.
	- Bring your own title.keys (and firmware)

## Common ROM File Extensions
- **.XCI**: Cartridge dump format. (Launchable in Emulator, without installing to NAND*)
- **.NSP**: eShop or digital game dump format. (Launchable in Emulator, without installing to NAND*)
- **.NSZ**: Compressed version of `.NSP` files. (No direct way to launch in Emulator*)
- **.XCZ**: Compressed version of `.XCI` files. (No direct way to launch in Emulator*)
- **.NCA**: Nintendo Content Archive, used to store game data, updates, or DLCs.

*: I don't have much experience with Ryujinx - I tested these with Citron, which is Yuzu-based, I think. Me being @Maingron.

- [Citron Emulator Official Website](https://citronemulator.net): Emulator
- [Yuzu Official Website](https://yuzu-emu.org): Emulator, taken down
- [Ryujinx Official Website](https://ryujinx.org): Emulator, taken down
- Remember there's the Internet Archive (Wayback machine) to visit offline websites.
- title.keys, prod.keys, firmware and games should be dumped from your own console. While available online for free, it might be illegal to download them, and might get you a virus. Be careful out there. Hacking your Switch to dump stuff yourself might get you banned from Nintendo Online Services, and might be impossible either way.
